## Usage

```
const picker = datepicker(selector, options);
```

Datepicker takes 2 arguments:

1. `selector` - two possibilities:
    1. `string` - a CSS selector, such as `'.my-class'`, `'#my-id'`, or `'div'`.
    2. `DOM node` - provide a DOM node, such as `document.querySelector('#my-id')`.
2. (optional) An object full of options (see below)

You can use Datepicker with any type of element you want. If used with an `<input>` element (the common use case), then the `<input>`'s value will automatically be set when selecting a date.

NOTE: Using `<input type="date">` will cause issues as those inputs already have a built in calendar. `datepicker` will not change the value of those inputs. Use `<input type="text">` instead.

Simplest example:
```javascript
const picker = datepicker('.some-element');
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
| -------| ----------- |
| `position` | (string) Can be 1 of 4 values: `'tr'`, `'tl'`, `'br'`, `'bl'` representing top-right, top-left, bottom-right, and bottom-left respectively. Datepicker will position itself accordingly relative to the element you reference in the 1st argument. |
| `startDate` | (JS date object) The month that the calendar will open up to. The default value is the current month. Example: `new Date()` |
| `dateSelected` | (JS date object) - This will start the calendar with a date already selected. If Datepicker is used with an `<input>` element, that field will be populated with this date as well. Example: `new Date(2017, 0, 15)` |
| `customMonths` | (Array) - Custom labels for months. It's length has to be 12. Starts at January (jan).
| `customDays`  | (Array) - Custom labels for days. It's length has to be 7. Starts at Sunday (sun).
| `minDate` | (JS date object) - This will be the minumum threshold of selectable dates. Anything prior will be unselectable. Example: `new Date(2016, 5, 1)` |
| `maxDate` | (JS date object) - This will be the maximum threshold of selectable dates. Anything after it will be unselectable. Example: `new Date(2017, 11, 31)` |
| `noWeekends` | (boolean) - Provide `true` to disable selecting weekends. |
| `formatter` | (function) - Provide a function that manually sets the provided input's value with your own formatting. This function is passed two arguments. 1st argument is the element `datepicker` is triggered on. 2nd argument is a JavaScript date object for the selected date. |
| `onSelect` | (function) - Callback function after a date has been selected. |
| `onShow` | (function) - Callback function when the calendar is shown. |
| `onHide` | (function) - Callback function when the calendar is hidden. |
| `onMonthchange` | (function) - Callback function when the month has changed. |
| `disableMobile` | (boolean) - Optionally disable Datepicker on mobile devices. This is handy if you'd like to trigger the mobile device's native date picker instead. |

_NOTE: All callback functions are both bound to the Datepicker instance and passed the instance as its 1st argument. So you can simply access the instance via the_ `this` _keyword or the 1st argument._


## Methods

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `.setDate` | Allows you to programmatically select a date on the calendar. It takes a JavaScript date object as it's only argument. E.x.: `picker.setDate(new Date(2099, 0, 5))` |
| `.remove` | Performs cleanup. Will remove various event listeners and mutation observers _only_ for the instance it's called on. So if there are multiple Datepickers on the page, the others will be unaffected.


## Properties & Values

If you take a look at the datepicker instance, you'll notice plenty of values that you can grab and use however you'd like. Let's say you instantiated datepicker as such:

```
const picker = datepicker('.some-class', {dateSelected: new Date(2099, 0, 5)});
```

Below will detail some helpful properties and values that are available on the `picker` example above.

| Property | Value |
| -------- | ----- |
| `calendar` | The calendar element. |
| `currentMonth` | A 0-index number representing the current month. For example, `0` represents January. |
| `currentMonthName` | Calendar month in plain english. E.x. `January` |
| `currentYear` | The current year. E.x. `2099` |
| `dateSelected` | The value of the selected date. This will be `undefined` if no date has been selected yet. |
| `el` | The element datepicker is relatively positioned against. |


## Sizing The Calendar

Styles for the calendar are compiled down to CSS from the `datepicker.less` file with `gulp`. All the sizes for the various portions of the calendar are relative to a single value at the top of that file: `@width: 250px;`. To resize the calendar, simply rebuild `datepicker.css` by doing the following:

1. Open `datepicker.less`
2. Change the `@width` variable to whatever value you want (try `350px`) and save.
3. From the command line run `gulp less`.


## Examples

Simplest usage:
```javascript
const picker = datepicker('#some-id');
```

With all options declared:
```javascript
const picker = datepicker(document.querySelector('#some-id'), {
  position: 'tr', // Top right.
  startDate: new Date(), // This month.
  dateSelected: new Date(), // Today is selected.
  minDate: new Date(2016, 5, 1), // June 1st, 2016.
  maxDate: new Date(2099, 0, 1), // Jan 1st, 2099.
  noWeekends: true, // Weekends will be unselectable.
  customMonths = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July',
    'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December'], // Labels for months
  customDays = ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat'], // Labels for days
  formatter: function(el, date) {
    // This will display the date as `1/1/2017`.
    el.value = date.toDateString();
  },
  onSelect: function(instance) {
    // Show which date was selected.
    console.log(instance.dateSelected);
  },
  onShow: function(instance) {
    console.log('Calendar showing.');
  },
  onHide: function(instance) {
    console.log('Calendar hidden.');
  },
  onMonthChange: function(instance) {
    // Show the month of the selected date.
    console.log(instance.currentMonthName);
  },
  disableMobile: true // Conditionally disabled on mobile devices.
});
```
